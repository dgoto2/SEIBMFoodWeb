# SEIBMFoodWeb
A spatially explicit individual-based food web model for a large ecosystem

## Description 
SEIBMFoodWeb is a spatially explicit indvidual-based model designed to simulate food web (including benthos, zooplankton, phytoplankton, forage fishes, and apex predatory fishes) dynamics in Lake Erie via individual-based processes including movement, foraging, growth, metabolism, maturation, reproduction, mortality, species interactions (competition, predation, etc.), and responses to environmental conditions.
